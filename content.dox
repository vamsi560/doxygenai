\section overview Overview

This project demonstrates automated documentation generation using Doxygen, with enhancements for generating a high-level architectural overview and integration with tools like Gemini for summarization. The core elements include source code analysis, dependency graph generation, and markdown summary creation.

\subsection graph_legend Graph Legend

The following legend describes the notation used in the dependency graph:

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
 <tr><td><div align="center"><img src="graph_legend.png" border="0" alt="Graph Legend key"/></div>		</td></tr>
</table>

\subsection dependencies Module and Class Dependencies

Here's a diagram showing the relationships between the modules, classes, and functions within the system. It illustrates the flow of control and dependencies between different components.

\section arch_analysis Analysis of the Architecture

The architecture comprises three main layers:

- **CLI Layer:** Represented by `main.cpp`, this is the entry point of the application.  It uses functionalities from the Services layer.

- **Services Layer:** Includes the `admin` and `faculty` classes, which encapsulate the core business logic and operations related to administrators and faculty members, respectively.

- **Modules Layer:**  Consists of header files `adminLogin.h` and `facultyLogin.h`.  These modules provide data structures and functions that are likely used by the Services layer for authentication or data handling related to admin and faculty logins.

The graph reveals the dependency flow: the `main.cpp` in the CLI layer utilizes the `admin` and `faculty` classes in the Services layer.  The Services layer, in turn, includes the modules for admin and faculty logins. This indicates a structured design where the CLI interacts with high-level services, which then rely on lower-level modules.
