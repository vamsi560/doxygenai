## üìÑ Summary

This documentation explains how to interpret graphs generated by Doxygen for visualizing class relationships.

**Box Appearance:**

*   **Filled Gray Box:** Represents the class/struct the graph is centered on.
*   **Black Border:** Documented class/struct.
*   **Gray Border:** Undocumented class/struct.
*   **Red Border:** Documented class/struct but the graph is truncated, and not all inheritance or containment relationships are shown.

**Arrow Appearance:**

*   **Blue Arrow:** Public inheritance.
*   **Dark Green Arrow:** Protected inheritance.
*   **Dark Red Arrow:** Private inheritance.
*   **Purple Dashed Arrow:** "Uses" or "Contains" relationship, labeled with the variable name used for access.
*   **Yellow Dashed Arrow:** Relation between a template instance and its template class, labeled with the template parameters.


## üìö Classes & Interfaces

Based on the provided documentation, here's a list of the classes and their brief roles as indicated:

*   **Invisible**: An example class that is not fully shown in the graph due to truncation.
*   **Truncated**: An example class where the inheritance relation is hidden due to truncation.
*   **Undocumented**: An example class that is not documented with Doxygen comments.
*   **PublicBase**: An example class that is inherited using public inheritance.
*   **Templ**: An example template class.
*   **ProtectedBase**: An example class that is inherited using protected inheritance.
*   **PrivateBase**: An example class that is inherited using private inheritance.
*   **Used**: An example class that is used by the Inherited class.
*   **Inherited**: An example class that inherits from several other classes using different inheritance types and contains a member of the `Used` class.

## ‚ùó TODOs & Undocumented Items

**TODOs:**

*   There are no explicit TODO statements in the provided text.

**Undocumented Parts:**

*   The exact method Doxygen uses to determine when a graph is "truncated" due to size limitations isn't specified.



## üìä Dependency Graph Overview

AutoDocs: Graph LegendAutoDocsLoading...Searching...No MatchesGraph LegendThis page explains how to interpret the graphs that are generated by doxygen.Consider the following example:/*! Invisible class because of truncation */classInvisible { };/*! Truncated class, inheritance relation is hidden */classTruncated :publicInvisible { };/* Class not documented with doxygen comments */classUndocumented { };/*! Class that is inherited using public inheritance */classPublicBase :publicTruncated { };/*! A template class */template<classT>classTempl { };/*! Class that is inherited using protected inheritance */classProtectedBase { };/*! Class that is inherited using private inheritance */classPrivateBase { };/*! Class that is used by the Inherited class */classUsed { };/*! Super class that inherits a number of other classes */classInherited :publicPublicBase,protectedProtectedBase,privatePrivateBase,publicUndocumented,publicTempl<int>{private:Used *m_usedClass;};This will result in the following graph:This browser is not able to show SVG: try Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Opera instead.The boxes in the above graph have the following meaning:A filled gray box represents the struct or class for which the graph is generated.A box with a black border denotes a documented struct or class.A box with a gray border denotes an undocumented struct or class.A box with a red border denotes a documented struct or class forwhich not all inheritance/containment relations are shown. A graph is truncated if it does not fit within the specified boundaries.The arrows have the following meaning:A blue arrow is used to visualize a public inheritance relation between two classes.A dark green arrow is used for protected inheritance.A dark red arrow is used for private inheritance.A purple dashed arrow is used if a class is contained or used by another class. The arrow is labelled with the variable(s) through which the pointed class or struct is accessible.A yellow dashed arrow denotes a relation between a template instance and the template class it was instantiated from. The arrow is labelled with the template parameters of the instance.Generated by1.9.8
