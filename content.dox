/*! \mainpage Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the system's architecture, focusing on the relationships between modules, classes, and functions.

\section architecture Architecture Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the system. It highlights the packages, services, and CLI layers, and their interactions.

\section graph_insights Graph Insights

The architecture is structured into three primary layers:

- **CLI Layer:** This layer provides the command-line interface for users to interact with the system.  The `cli` node represents the main entry point for executing tasks and triggering underlying services. The entrypoint is located in `generate_docs.py`
- **Service Layer:** This layer encompasses the core business logic of the application. The `admin` and `faculty` classes encapsulate functionalities related to administrative and faculty tasks, respectively.  These classes orchestrate actions and interact with the Model Layer.
- **Model Layer:** This layer represents the data model and configuration files used by the services.  The `Doxyfile` is a key component in this layer, defining the configuration for the Doxygen documentation generation tool.
- **Gemini AI:** This service uses the Gemini AI api, and is configured with an API key.

The `CLI Layer` drives the services.  The Service layer then uses the `Model Layer` and `Gemini AI` to carry out tasks.  This design promotes modularity and separation of concerns.
