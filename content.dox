/*! \mainpage Architecture and Code Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the project's architecture, focusing on the relationships between modules, classes, and functions. It includes a visual representation of the project's structure using a dot diagram and a detailed explanation of the relationships between key components.

\section overview Project Overview

This project consists of several modules organized to provide a structured and maintainable architecture. Key components include:

- **CLI Layer**: Handles command-line interface interactions.
- **Service Layer**: Implements the core business logic and functionalities.
- **Data Layer**: Manages data storage and retrieval.

\section architecture_explanation Diagram Explanation

The architecture diagram illustrates the high-level structure of the project and the dependencies between its main modules.
- CLI interacts with the Service Layer.
- The Service Layer, containing business logic, uses the Data Layer for data persistence and retrieval.

\section module_relationships Module Relationships

- **CLI Module**: This module is responsible for parsing command-line arguments and invoking the appropriate functions in the Service Layer.  It acts as the entry point for user interactions.

- **Service Module**: This module encapsulates the core business logic of the application.  It receives requests from the CLI Module, processes them, and interacts with the Data Layer to persist or retrieve data.  It serves as an intermediary between the user interface and the data storage mechanisms.

- **Data Module**: This module handles all data-related operations, such as reading from and writing to a database or file system.  It provides an abstraction layer that allows the Service Module to interact with data without needing to know the underlying storage details.

\section class_relationships Class Relationships

- **admin Class**: Handles operations related to managing faculty/batch/schedule by admin.

- **faculty Class**: Handles operations related to schedule by faculty.
