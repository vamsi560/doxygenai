## üìÑ Summary

This documentation explains how to interpret the inheritance and usage graphs generated by Doxygen.

**Box Meanings:**

*   **Filled Gray Box:** The class/struct the graph is about.
*   **Black Border:** A documented class/struct.
*   **Gray Border:** An undocumented class/struct.
*   **Red Border:** A documented class/struct with truncated inheritance/containment relations (not all relationships shown).

**Arrow Meanings:**

*   **Blue Arrow:** Public inheritance.
*   **Dark Green Arrow:** Protected inheritance.
*   **Dark Red Arrow:** Private inheritance.
*   **Purple Dashed Arrow:** Class containment/usage.  The arrow is labeled with the variable(s) used to access the pointed-to class/struct.
*   **Yellow Dashed Arrow:** Relation between a template instance and its template class, labeled with the template parameters.


## üìö Classes & Interfaces

Based on the provided documentation generated by Doxygen, here's a list of the classes and their roles:

*   **Invisible**: A class that is not visible because of truncation in the generated graph.
*   **Truncated**: A class whose inheritance relation is hidden due to graph truncation.
*   **Undocumented**: A class that lacks Doxygen comments.
*   **PublicBase**: A class inherited using public inheritance.
*   **Templ<T>**: A template class.
*   **ProtectedBase**: A class inherited using protected inheritance.
*   **PrivateBase**: A class inherited using private inheritance.
*   **Used**: A class used by the `Inherited` class.
*   **Inherited**: A class that inherits from multiple other classes using public, protected, and private inheritance, and also uses another class.

## ‚ùó TODOs & Undocumented Items

**TODOs:**

*   The page doesn't specify how to configure the graph generation in Doxygen.

**Undocumented parts:**

*   The page lacks information on how to customize the appearance of the graphs (e.g., colors, fonts, size).
*   There is no explanation of the configuration settings that affect graph generation.
*   The page doesn't mention limitations of the graph generation feature.
*   The document does not have example graphs that demonstrate different complex relationship scenarios, such as multiple inheritance, nested classes, or friend relationships.


## üìä Dependency Graph Overview

AutoDocs: Graph LegendAutoDocsLoading...Searching...No MatchesGraph LegendThis page explains how to interpret the graphs that are generated by doxygen.Consider the following example:/*! Invisible class because of truncation */classInvisible { };/*! Truncated class, inheritance relation is hidden */classTruncated :publicInvisible { };/* Class not documented with doxygen comments */classUndocumented { };/*! Class that is inherited using public inheritance */classPublicBase :publicTruncated { };/*! A template class */template<classT>classTempl { };/*! Class that is inherited using protected inheritance */classProtectedBase { };/*! Class that is inherited using private inheritance */classPrivateBase { };/*! Class that is used by the Inherited class */classUsed { };/*! Super class that inherits a number of other classes */classInherited :publicPublicBase,protectedProtectedBase,privatePrivateBase,publicUndocumented,publicTempl<int>{private:Used *m_usedClass;};This will result in the following graph:This browser is not able to show SVG: try Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Opera instead.The boxes in the above graph have the following meaning:A filled gray box represents the struct or class for which the graph is generated.A box with a black border denotes a documented struct or class.A box with a gray border denotes an undocumented struct or class.A box with a red border denotes a documented struct or class forwhich not all inheritance/containment relations are shown. A graph is truncated if it does not fit within the specified boundaries.The arrows have the following meaning:A blue arrow is used to visualize a public inheritance relation between two classes.A dark green arrow is used for protected inheritance.A dark red arrow is used for private inheritance.A purple dashed arrow is used if a class is contained or used by another class. The arrow is labelled with the variable(s) through which the pointed class or struct is accessible.A yellow dashed arrow denotes a relation between a template instance and the template class it was instantiated from. The arrow is labelled with the template parameters of the instance.Generated by1.9.8
