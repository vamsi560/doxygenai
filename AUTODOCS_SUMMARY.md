## üìÑ Summary

This documentation explains the legend for graphs generated by Doxygen. The graphs visually represent class relationships like inheritance and containment. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Boxes:**
    *   **Filled Gray:** The class for which the graph is generated.
    *   **Black Border:** Documented class or struct.
    *   **Gray Border:** Undocumented class or struct.
    *   **Red Border:** Documented class/struct where not all inheritance/containment relationships are shown (truncated graph due to size limits).

*   **Arrows:**
    *   **Blue:** Public inheritance.
    *   **Dark Green:** Protected inheritance.
    *   **Dark Red:** Private inheritance.
    *   **Purple Dashed:** Class contains/uses another class, labeled with the variable name for access.
    *   **Yellow Dashed:** Relation between a template instance and its template class, labeled with template parameters.

## üìö Classes & Interfaces

Based on the provided documentation, here's a list of the classes mentioned and their roles in the context of the Doxygen graph visualization:

*   **Invisible:** A class that's not fully shown in the graph due to truncation.
*   **Truncated:** A class where the inheritance relation is hidden due to truncation.
*   **Undocumented:** A class that lacks Doxygen comments.
*   **PublicBase:** A class inherited using public inheritance.
*   **Templ:** A template class.
*   **ProtectedBase:** A class inherited using protected inheritance.
*   **PrivateBase:** A class inherited using private inheritance.
*   **Used:** A class used by the `Inherited` class (through a member variable).
*   **Inherited:** A class that inherits from multiple classes using different inheritance types and contains an instance of the `Used` class.

I hope this is helpful!


## ‚ùó TODOs & Undocumented Items

## TODOs:

*   **Missing graph image:** The text mentions "This will result in the following graph:" but the image is not present. This is a critical issue as the entire page is about explaining the graph's legend.
*   **Improve Search Functionality:** "Loading..." and "No Matches" suggest the search functionality is either not working correctly or is not implemented properly.

## Undocumented Parts:

*   **Search Functionality:** The purpose and limitations of the search functionality are not documented.
*   **Boundaries for Truncation:** The document mentions that a graph is truncated if it does not fit within the specified boundaries, but the method and criteria for determining the specified boundaries are not mentioned.
*   **Generated by Version:** While the "Generated by" information is present, the significance of this information (e.g., compatibility or version-specific behaviors) is not explained.



## üìä Dependency Graph Overview

AutoDocs: Graph LegendAutoDocsLoading...Searching...No MatchesGraph LegendThis page explains how to interpret the graphs that are generated by doxygen.Consider the following example:/*! Invisible class because of truncation */classInvisible { };/*! Truncated class, inheritance relation is hidden */classTruncated :publicInvisible { };/* Class not documented with doxygen comments */classUndocumented { };/*! Class that is inherited using public inheritance */classPublicBase :publicTruncated { };/*! A template class */template<classT>classTempl { };/*! Class that is inherited using protected inheritance */classProtectedBase { };/*! Class that is inherited using private inheritance */classPrivateBase { };/*! Class that is used by the Inherited class */classUsed { };/*! Super class that inherits a number of other classes */classInherited :publicPublicBase,protectedProtectedBase,privatePrivateBase,publicUndocumented,publicTempl<int>{private:Used *m_usedClass;};This will result in the following graph:This browser is not able to show SVG: try Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Opera instead.The boxes in the above graph have the following meaning:A filled gray box represents the struct or class for which the graph is generated.A box with a black border denotes a documented struct or class.A box with a gray border denotes an undocumented struct or class.A box with a red border denotes a documented struct or class forwhich not all inheritance/containment relations are shown. A graph is truncated if it does not fit within the specified boundaries.The arrows have the following meaning:A blue arrow is used to visualize a public inheritance relation between two classes.A dark green arrow is used for protected inheritance.A dark red arrow is used for private inheritance.A purple dashed arrow is used if a class is contained or used by another class. The arrow is labelled with the variable(s) through which the pointed class or struct is accessible.A yellow dashed arrow denotes a relation between a template instance and the template class it was instantiated from. The arrow is labelled with the template parameters of the instance.Generated by1.9.8
