This document provides a comprehensive overview of a C++ project, "Project_Flies," located on a user's (AZUREU~1) local machine. It includes detailed documentation generated by Doxygen, encompassing the project's file structure, classes, functions, and their relationships.

Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

**1. Project Structure:**

*   The project is organized into `include` and `src` directories.
*   The `include` directory contains header files (`adminLogin.h`, `facultyLogin.h`) defining classes and functions.
*   The `src` directory contains the main source file (`main.cpp`).

**2. Classes:**

*   **`admin`:** Defined in `adminLogin.h`, provides functionalities for admin users such as creating, updating, and managing training schedules, allotting trainers, and generating reports. Functions include: `createSchedule()`, `updateSchedule()`, `allotTrainer()`, `generateReport()`, and `adminModules()`.
*   **`faculty`:** Defined in `facultyLogin.h`, provides functionalities for faculty users such as viewing and canceling training schedules.  Attributes: `loginId`, `status` Functions include: `viewSchedule()`, `cancelSchedule()`, and `facultyModules()`.

**3. Key Functions:**

*   **`main()` (in `main.cpp`):** The entry point of the program.
*   **Functions in `adminLogin.h`:** `checkdate()`, `countLeapYearDays()`, `countNoOfDays()`, `validateString()`.  These are helper functions used within the admin class.
*   **Member functions in `admin` and `faculty` classes:**  Provide the core functionalities for each user type.

**4. Data Storage:**

*   The project appears to use CSV files (`schedule.csv`, `trainerallotment.csv`) to store training schedule and trainer allotment data.

**5. Documentation Generation:**

*   The documentation was generated using Doxygen. The presence of files and directories like `docs/latest`, `docs/v-xxx`, and `generate_docs.py` suggests that automated documentation generation is in place.
* The use of `generate_docs.py` and presence of the Gemini API key suggests an attempt to use AI to generate documentation.

**6. Core Functionality based on `adminLogin.h` and `facultyLogin.h`:**

*   The project implements basic admin and faculty login functionalities.
*   Admins can create and manage training schedules, assign trainers, and generate reports.
*   Faculty can view their assigned schedules and request schedule cancellations.

**7. Architecture Overview:**

*   **CLI Layer:** `main.cpp` handles user input.
*   **Services Layer:** `adminLogin.h` and `facultyLogin.h` provide authentication and authorization.
*   **Data Layer:** CSV files for storing schedule and trainer information.

**In essence, the project is a C++ application for managing training schedules, with separate functionalities for administrators and faculty members. It's documented using Doxygen, providing insights into its structure and components.**
