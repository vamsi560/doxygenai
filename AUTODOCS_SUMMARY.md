## üìÑ Summary

This documentation explains how to interpret inheritance and dependency graphs generated by Doxygen. Key points:

*   **Boxes:** Gray filled boxes represent the class the graph is generated for. Black borders indicate documented classes/structs. Gray borders indicate undocumented classes/structs. Red borders indicate truncated graphs (not all relationships shown).
*   **Arrows:** Blue arrows represent public inheritance. Dark green arrows represent protected inheritance. Dark red arrows represent private inheritance. Purple dashed arrows show containment/usage relationships, labeled with the variable name used for access. Yellow dashed arrows indicate template instantiation, labeled with the template parameters.


## üìö Classes & Interfaces

Based on the provided documentation, the following classes are mentioned, along with their roles as depicted in the doxygen-generated graphs:

*   **Invisible:** A class that is invisible due to truncation in the generated graph.

*   **Truncated:** A class whose inheritance relation is hidden due to truncation.

*   **Undocumented:** A class that is not documented with doxygen comments.

*   **PublicBase:** A class that is inherited using public inheritance.

*   **Templ<T>:** A template class.

*   **ProtectedBase:** A class that is inherited using protected inheritance.

*   **PrivateBase:** A class that is inherited using private inheritance.

*   **Used:** A class that is used by the Inherited class.

*   **Inherited:** A super class that inherits a number of other classes using public, protected, and private inheritance, and also uses the "Used" class.


## ‚ùó TODOs & Undocumented Items

**TODOs:**

*   There are no explicit TODOs mentioned in the provided text.

**Undocumented parts:**

*   The exact criteria for truncation of the inheritance/containment relations are not explained. It mentions "if it does not fit within the specified boundaries" but doesn't specify how these boundaries are defined or configured.
*   The text doesn't explain how to configure the graph generation, i.e., how to set the boundaries or influence the truncation behavior.
*   No explanation of what "AutoDocs" actually *is*. What software/library/project is this documenting? What is its purpose?


## üìä Dependency Graph Overview

AutoDocs: Graph LegendAutoDocsLoading...Searching...No MatchesGraph LegendThis page explains how to interpret the graphs that are generated by doxygen.Consider the following example:/*! Invisible class because of truncation */classInvisible { };/*! Truncated class, inheritance relation is hidden */classTruncated :publicInvisible { };/* Class not documented with doxygen comments */classUndocumented { };/*! Class that is inherited using public inheritance */classPublicBase :publicTruncated { };/*! A template class */template<classT>classTempl { };/*! Class that is inherited using protected inheritance */classProtectedBase { };/*! Class that is inherited using private inheritance */classPrivateBase { };/*! Class that is used by the Inherited class */classUsed { };/*! Super class that inherits a number of other classes */classInherited :publicPublicBase,protectedProtectedBase,privatePrivateBase,publicUndocumented,publicTempl<int>{private:Used *m_usedClass;};This will result in the following graph:This browser is not able to show SVG: try Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Opera instead.The boxes in the above graph have the following meaning:A filled gray box represents the struct or class for which the graph is generated.A box with a black border denotes a documented struct or class.A box with a gray border denotes an undocumented struct or class.A box with a red border denotes a documented struct or class forwhich not all inheritance/containment relations are shown. A graph is truncated if it does not fit within the specified boundaries.The arrows have the following meaning:A blue arrow is used to visualize a public inheritance relation between two classes.A dark green arrow is used for protected inheritance.A dark red arrow is used for private inheritance.A purple dashed arrow is used if a class is contained or used by another class. The arrow is labelled with the variable(s) through which the pointed class or struct is accessible.A yellow dashed arrow denotes a relation between a template instance and the template class it was instantiated from. The arrow is labelled with the template parameters of the instance.Generated by1.9.8
