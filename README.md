This documentation outlines the structure and functionality of a C++ project named "Project_Flies," which appears to be a training schedule management system. The project is divided into `include` and `src` directories.

**Key components:**

*   **Classes:** `admin` and `faculty`. The `admin` class manages training schedules, trainers, and reports, while the `faculty` class handles faculty-related operations like viewing and canceling schedules.

*   **Header files:**
    *   `adminLogin.h`: Defines the `admin` class and functions for creating, updating, and managing training schedules.
    *   `facultyLogin.h`: Defines the `faculty` class and functions for faculty members to view and cancel their schedules.

*   **Source file:**
    *   `main.cpp`: Contains the `main` function, which likely serves as the entry point to the application and manages the login process for both administrators and faculty members.

*   **Utility functions:** Several functions in `adminLogin.h` are used for date validation (`checkdate`), calculating leap years and the number of days between dates (`countLeapYearDays`, `countNoOfDays`), and validating string inputs (`validateString`).

*   **Documentation:** The documentation was generated using Doxygen. It includes directory structures, file references, class references, member lists, graphs, and an AutoDocs documentation that gives an architectural overview of the project.

**Overall, the project seems to provide a system where administrators can create and manage training schedules, assign trainers, and generate reports, while faculty members can access their schedules and request cancellations.** The documentation generated offers a detailed view into the project structure and the interaction between different modules.
