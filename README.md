This document provides a comprehensive overview of a C++ project called "Project_Flies," including its file structure, classes, functions, and documentation. Here's a breakdown:

**Project Structure:**

*   The project is located in a temporary directory on a user's (AZUREU~1) machine.
*   It contains two main directories: `include` and `src`.
*   The `include` directory holds header files:
    *   `adminLogin.h`: Defines the `admin` class and related functions for managing training schedules.
    *   `facultyLogin.h`: Defines the `faculty` class and related functions for viewing and managing assigned schedules.
*   The `src` directory contains:
    *   `main.cpp`: The main program file, which likely handles user interaction and calls functions from the `admin` and `faculty` classes.

**Classes and Functions:**

*   **`admin` Class (defined in `adminLogin.h`):**
    *   Has functions to:
        *   `createSchedule()`: Creates a new training schedule, collecting details like batch ID, technology, dates, venue, etc.
        *   `updateSchedule()`: Modifies an existing schedule.
        *   `allotTrainer()`: Assigns a trainer to a specific technology.
        *   `generateReport()`: Creates a report based on month and technology.
        *   `adminModules()`: Displays the main admin dashboard and options.
    *   Includes validation to make sure data being input is the correct datatype (string values only, correct date formatting, etc.)
*   **`faculty` Class (defined in `facultyLogin.h`):**
    *   Attributes:
        *   `loginId` (string): faculty member login id
    *   Has functions to:
        *   `viewSchedule()`: Allows a faculty member to view their assigned training schedule based on their name.
        *   `cancelSchedule()`: Lets the faculty member request the cancellation of their schedule.
        *   `facultyModules()`: Displays the faculty dashboard and options.
*   **Functions in `adminLogin.h`:**
    *   `checkdate(int d, int m, int y)`: Validates a given date (day, month, year).
    *   `countLeapYearDays(int d[])`: Counts the number of leap years up to a given year.
    *   `countNoOfDays(int date1[], int date2[])`: Calculates the number of days between two dates.
    *   `validateString(string str)`: Checks if a string contains only alphabetical characters.
*   **Global Variables (defined in `adminLogin.h` and `facultyLogin.h`):**
    *   `batchID`, `nod`, `nop`: Integer variables likely representing batch ID, number of days, and number of participants.
    *   `technology`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `venueDetail`, `month`, `facultyName`: String variables holding schedule-related information.
    *   `status`: faculty schedule status
    *   `monthDays`: an array holding days of the month

**Documentation Generation:**

*   The project uses Doxygen to automatically generate documentation from the source code comments.
*   A `generate_docs.py` script is included, which seems to be responsible for:
    *   Running Doxygen.
    *   Extracting text.
    *   Saving the documentation.
    *   Generating a markdown summary.
*   The documentation is structured into various directories (e.g., `latest`, `v-495b624`, `v-e8a2192`) to manage different versions of the documentation.

**Architecture Overview**

* The architecture comprises three main layers:
    * CLI Layer: Represented by main.cpp, this is the entry point of the application. It uses functionalities from the Services layer.
    * Services Layer: Includes the admin and faculty classes, which encapsulate the core business logic and operations related to administrators and faculty members, respectively.
    * Modules Layer: Consists of header files adminLogin.h and facultyLogin.h. These modules provide data structures and functions that are likely used by the Services layer for authentication or data handling related to admin and faculty logins.
*   The graph reveals the dependency flow: the main.cpp in the CLI layer utilizes the admin and faculty classes in the Services layer. The Services layer, in turn, includes the modules for admin and faculty logins. This indicates a structured design where the CLI interacts with high-level services, which then rely on lower-level modules.

**Key Observations:**

*   The project follows a structured approach with well-defined classes and functions.
*   It utilizes file I/O (fstream) to manage schedule data.
*   There is a clear separation of concerns between the UI (main.cpp), business logic (admin and faculty classes), and data handling.
*   The use of Doxygen and a custom documentation generation script highlights the importance of maintaining up-to-date documentation.
*   The system allows an admin to create, update, generate reports, and allot trainers to schedules.
*   The faculty member can then view the assigned schedule and confirm whether to accept the schedule.
