/*! \mainpage AutoDocs Project
 *
 *  Welcome to the AutoDocs project documentation! This documentation provides
 *  an overview of the project's architecture, key components, and their
 *  interactions.
 *
 *  \section architecture Architecture Overview
 *
 *  The project follows a layered architecture consisting of the following
 *  logical layers:
 *  - CLI (Command Line Interface):  Entry point for users to interact with the system.
 *  - Services: Business logic and core functionalities.
 *  - Modules: Collections of functions and classes providing specific utilities or features.
 *
 *  \section module_interaction Module Interaction Diagram
 *  The following diagram illustrates the interaction between the main modules, classes and functions
 *  within the system.  It highlights the dependencies and relationships between different parts
 *  of the codebase.

 *
 *  \section graph_explanation Graph Explanation
 *
 *  The diagram shows a simplified architecture, primarily revolving around the 'Admin Login Module'
 *  and 'Faculty Login Module' and its relation to the CLI layer,
 *
 *  - The `Admin Login Module` encompasses the `admin` class and validation functions.
 *  - The `admin` class, being central, directly uses functions like `checkdate`, `countLeapYearDays`,
 *    `countNoOfDays`, and `validateString` for input validation.
 *  - The `Faculty Login Module` is represented by `faculty` class.
 *  - The `CLI` interacts with both the Admin and Faculty modules, allowing the users to access the functionality through admin and faculty login.
 *
 *  This structure highlights a clear separation of concerns, with dedicated modules for login management and a centralized CLI for user interaction.
 *
 *  \section next_steps Further Documentation
 *  - Refer to the class and module documentation for detailed information on specific components.
 *  - Consult the user guide for instructions on how to use the CLI.
