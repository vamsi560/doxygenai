/**\mainpage Auto-generated Documentation
Okay, I'm ready. Please provide the code files so I can analyze them and generate the `content.dox` file as you described. I'll pay close attention to:

*   **Identifying Controllers, Models, Services, and Views:**  I'll analyze namespaces, class names, and inheritance to correctly classify each component.
*   **Relationship Extraction:**  I'll look for dependency injection, method calls, and data flow between components to understand how they interact.
*   **Diagram Generation:** I will output the code required to create the `@dot` diagram showing the relationships.
*   **Doxygen Compatibility:** I'll ensure the syntax is correct for Doxygen to process.
*   **Filtering:**  Excluding test, build, and resource files as specified.
*   **Structure:** Top-down flow with clear groupings and subgroups.
*   **Explanatory Section:** Adding a `\section` at the end to explain the diagram.

Once you provide the files, I'll generate the `content.dox` file.

**Example of the expected output (which I will generate based on your code):**

\section overview Overview

This documentation provides an overview of the project's architecture, focusing on the relationships between Controllers, Models, Services, and Views.

\section architecture Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the project's architecture and the interaction between key components:

@dot
digraph Architecture {
    rankdir="TB"; // Top-to-bottom layout

    node [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=lightblue];
    subgraph cluster_Controllers {
        label = "Controllers";
        node [fillcolor=lightgreen];
        HomeController [label="HomeController"];
        // Add other controllers here
    }

    subgraph cluster_Services {
        label = "Services";
        node [fillcolor=lightyellow];
        MyService [label="MyService"];
        // Add other services here
    }

    subgraph cluster_Models {
        label = "Models";
        node [fillcolor=lightcoral];
        MyModel [label="MyModel"];
        // Add other models here
    }

    subgraph cluster_Views {
        label = "Views";
        node [shape=note, fillcolor=lightgrey];
        IndexView [label="Index.cshtml"];
        // Add other views here
    }

    // Define relationships between components
    HomeController -> MyService [label="Uses"];
    MyService -> MyModel [label="Operates on"];
    HomeController -> IndexView [label="Renders"];
    // Add other relationships here
}
@enddot

\section diagram_explanation Diagram Explanation

This diagram illustrates the flow of control and data within the application:

- **Controllers:**  Handle user requests and orchestrate the application logic.  In this example, `HomeController` receives requests.
- **Services:**  Encapsulate business logic and data access. `MyService` performs specific operations.
- **Models:**  Represent the data structures used by the application. `MyModel` holds data.
- **Views:**  Display data to the user. `Index.cshtml` presents the user interface.

The arrows indicate the direction of dependency or data flow. For example, `HomeController` uses `MyService` to perform certain tasks, and `MyService` operates on `MyModel`. The `HomeController` then renders the `IndexView` to display the results.
