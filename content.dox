\section intro_sec Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of the AutoDocs project, generated using Doxygen and Gemini.
It covers the project's structure, key classes, and their interactions.

\section architecture_sec Project Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture, comprising a CLI layer, services layer, and data layer.
The following diagram illustrates the relationships between the key components.

\subsection arch_explanation Diagram Explanation

This diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the system:
- **CLI Layer:**  The command-line interface serves as the entry point for users to interact with the system.
- **Services Layer:** This layer encapsulates the business logic and provides services related to admin and faculty operations.
- **Data Layer:**  This layer contains the `Admin` and `Faculty` classes, representing data models and their associated functionalities.

\section class_relationships Class and Module Relationships

The project includes two main classes, `Admin` and `Faculty`, which have distinct roles within the system.

- The `Admin` class handles administrative tasks, such as creating and updating schedules, allotting trainers, and generating reports.
- The `Faculty` class is responsible for faculty-related operations, including viewing and canceling schedules.
- The CLI interacts with the admin and faculty modules.
