This document provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture, code structure, and functionality of a training schedule management system. It includes documentation for the `adminLogin.h` and `facultyLogin.h` header files, along with the `main.cpp` source file. Key aspects of the system include:

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Layered Design:** The system employs a three-layered architecture:
    *   **CLI Layer:** Command-line interface for user interaction, driven by `generate_docs.py`.
    *   **Service Layer:** Contains core business logic encapsulated in the `admin` and `faculty` classes, responsible for administrative and faculty tasks.
    *   **Model Layer:** Data model and configuration files, including `Doxyfile` for documentation generation.
*   **Gemini AI Integration:** Uses the Gemini AI API, configured with an API key.

**2. Key Header Files:**

*   **adminLogin.h:** Defines the `admin` class, which provides functionalities for:
    *   Creating, updating, and managing training schedules.
    *   Allotting trainers to schedules.
    *   Generating reports.
    *   Admin dashboard.
    *   Includes functions for date validation, leap year calculations, and string validation.
*   **facultyLogin.h:** Defines the `faculty` class, enabling faculties to:
    *   View their assigned training schedules.
    *   Request cancellation of schedules.
    *   Faculty dashboard.

**3. Source File (main.cpp):**

*   Contains the `main` function, serving as the entry point of the application.
*   Includes `adminLogin.h` and `facultyLogin.h` to utilize the defined classes.

**4. Documentation Generation:**

*   The `generate_docs.py` script is used to generate documentation using Doxygen.
*   It extracts text from source files, generates Markdown documentation, and saves it in various formats.
*   Uses the Gemini AI API to enhance documentation.

**5. Key Classes and Functions:**

*   **admin Class:**
    *   `createSchedule()`: Creates a new training schedule, prompting for details such as batch ID, technology, dates, venue, and participants.
    *   `updateSchedule()`: Modifies an existing schedule based on batch ID.
    *   `allotTrainer()`: Assigns a trainer to a specific technology.
    *   `generateReport()`: Generates a report for a specific month and technology.
    *   `adminModules()`:  Displays the admin dashboard with options to perform various tasks.
*   **faculty Class:**
    *   `viewSchedule()`: Displays the faculty's training schedule based on their name.
    *   `cancelSchedule()`: Allows faculty to request cancellation of their schedule.
    *   `facultyModules()`: Displays the faculty dashboard with options to view or cancel schedules.
*   **Functions:**
    *   `checkdate()`: Validates a given date (day, month, year).
    *   `countLeapYearDays()`: Calculates the number of leap years.
    *   `countNoOfDays()`: Calculates the number of days between two dates.
    *   `validateString()`: Validates that a string contains only alphabetic characters.

**6. Other Relevant Information:**

*   Includes directory structures for documentation and source code.
*   Provides a graph legend explaining the symbols and arrows used in Doxygen-generated graphs.
*   Lists file and namespace members, including functions and variables, with links to their documentation.
*   Includes javascript files used for the website

In essence, this documentation offers a comprehensive understanding of the structure and operation of the training schedule management system.
