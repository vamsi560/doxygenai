# AutoDocs Summary (via Gemini + Doxygen)

## üìÑ Summary

This document is the main page of API documentation for a project called "AutoDocs". The documentation was generated by Doxygen 1.9.8. It includes standard HTML structure, metadata, links to stylesheets and JavaScript files for formatting and search functionality, and a basic header with the project title. The content area is currently empty, indicating that the actual documentation content would be found on other pages within this framework.

Graph Legend
This page explains how to interpret the graphs that are generated by doxygen.
Consider the following example:
/*! Invisible class because of truncation */
class
Invisible { };
/*! Truncated class, inheritance relation is hidden */
class
Truncated :
public
Invisible { };
/* Class not documented with doxygen comments */
class
Undocumented { };
/*! Class that is inherited using public inheritance */
class
PublicBase :
public
Truncated { };
/*! A template class */
template
<
class
T>
class
Templ { };
/*! Class that is inherited using protected inheritance */
class
ProtectedBase { };
/*! Class that is inherited using private inheritance */
class
PrivateBase { };
/*! Class that is used by the Inherited class */
class
Used { };
/*! Super class that inherits a number of other classes */
class
Inherited :
public
PublicBase,
protected
ProtectedBase,
private
PrivateBase,
public
Undocumented,
public
Templ<int>
{
private
:
Used *m_usedClass;
};
This will result in the following graph:
This browser is not able to show SVG: try Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Opera instead.
The boxes in the above graph have the following meaning:
A filled gray box represents the struct or class for which the graph is generated.
A box with a black border denotes a documented struct or class.
A box with a gray border denotes an undocumented struct or class.
A box with a red border denotes a documented struct or class forwhich not all inheritance/containment relations are shown. A graph is truncated if it does not fit within the specified boundaries.
The arrows have the following meaning:
A blue arrow is used to visualize a public inheritance relation between two classes.
A dark green arrow is used for protected inheritance.
A dark red arrow is used for private inheritance.
A purple dashed arrow is used if a class is contained or used by another class. The arrow is labelled with the variable(s) through which the pointed class
