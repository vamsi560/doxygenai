## üìÑ Summary

This documentation explains how to interpret graphs generated by Doxygen. The key takeaways are:

*   **Box Colors:**
    *   Filled gray: The class/struct for which the graph is generated.
    *   Black border: Documented class/struct.
    *   Gray border: Undocumented class/struct.
    *   Red border: Documented class/struct with truncated inheritance/containment.

*   **Arrow Colors and Styles:**
    *   Blue arrow: Public inheritance.
    *   Dark green arrow: Protected inheritance.
    *   Dark red arrow: Private inheritance.
    *   Purple dashed arrow: Containment/Usage (labeled with variable name).
    *   Yellow dashed arrow: Template instantiation (labeled with template parameters).

The documentation uses a code example with classes exhibiting different inheritance types, undocumented classes, template classes, and containment to illustrate the graph legend.


## üìö Classes & Interfaces

Based on the provided Doxygen documentation, the following classes are mentioned with their roles:

*   **Invisible:** A class that is not fully shown in the graph due to truncation.
*   **Truncated:** A class where the inheritance relation is hidden because the graph is truncated.
*   **Undocumented:** A class that is not documented with Doxygen comments.
*   **PublicBase:** A class that is inherited using public inheritance.
*   **Templ<T>:** A template class.
*   **ProtectedBase:** A class that is inherited using protected inheritance.
*   **PrivateBase:** A class that is inherited using private inheritance.
*   **Used:** A class that is used by the Inherited class.
*   **Inherited:** A class that inherits from multiple other classes using different inheritance types (public, protected, private) and uses the "Used" class.

## ‚ùó TODOs & Undocumented Items

Okay, I've reviewed the provided text and identified the following TODOs and undocumented parts:

**TODOs:**

*   **SVG Display Issue:**  "This browser is not able to show SVG: try Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Opera instead." This indicates a potential compatibility issue with the current browser being used to view the documentation.  It's a TODO to either:
    *   Ensure SVG support across common browsers.
    *   Provide a fallback image format (e.g., PNG) for browsers that don't support SVG.
    *   Clearly document the supported browsers and the need for SVG support.

**Undocumented Parts/Potential Improvements:**

*   **No explanation of "AutoDocs":** The documentation titles are "AutoDocs: Graph Legend" and "AutoDocs: Main Page". The reader may not know what this "AutoDocs" is actually referring to. A brief explanation in the main page of what "AutoDocs" represents (a project, library, tool, etc.) would be helpful.
*   **Missing Information on Graph Truncation:**  The documentation mentions that a red border indicates truncated inheritance/containment relations. However, it lacks details on *why* truncation happens or how to *control* it.  It would be helpful to:
    *   Explain the limits that cause truncation (e.g., maximum graph size, node count).
    *   Mention if there are doxygen configuration options to adjust these limits or disable truncation.
*   **Lack of Examples for Containment/Usage:** The explanation of the purple dashed arrow for containment/usage is clear, but it would be even better to have a more complete code example demonstrating this relationship and how the labels on the arrow are derived from the code. Showing an example where `m_usedClass` isn't used at all, or if it was a vector of Used, or a shared_ptr of Used, would be useful.
*   **Template Class Arrow Clarification:** The yellow dashed arrow and its meaning are fairly clear, but an example where the template parameter is a class that has its own complex inheritance or containment relationships would strengthen the explanation.

In essence, the current documentation is functional but can be enhanced by addressing the SVG display issue, adding context to "AutoDocs", providing more detail on graph truncation, and including more diverse and complex examples for containment/usage and template relationships.


## üìä Dependency Graph Overview

AutoDocs: Graph LegendAutoDocsLoading...Searching...No MatchesGraph LegendThis page explains how to interpret the graphs that are generated by doxygen.Consider the following example:/*! Invisible class because of truncation */classInvisible { };/*! Truncated class, inheritance relation is hidden */classTruncated :publicInvisible { };/* Class not documented with doxygen comments */classUndocumented { };/*! Class that is inherited using public inheritance */classPublicBase :publicTruncated { };/*! A template class */template<classT>classTempl { };/*! Class that is inherited using protected inheritance */classProtectedBase { };/*! Class that is inherited using private inheritance */classPrivateBase { };/*! Class that is used by the Inherited class */classUsed { };/*! Super class that inherits a number of other classes */classInherited :publicPublicBase,protectedProtectedBase,privatePrivateBase,publicUndocumented,publicTempl<int>{private:Used *m_usedClass;};This will result in the following graph:This browser is not able to show SVG: try Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Opera instead.The boxes in the above graph have the following meaning:A filled gray box represents the struct or class for which the graph is generated.A box with a black border denotes a documented struct or class.A box with a gray border denotes an undocumented struct or class.A box with a red border denotes a documented struct or class forwhich not all inheritance/containment relations are shown. A graph is truncated if it does not fit within the specified boundaries.The arrows have the following meaning:A blue arrow is used to visualize a public inheritance relation between two classes.A dark green arrow is used for protected inheritance.A dark red arrow is used for private inheritance.A purple dashed arrow is used if a class is contained or used by another class. The arrow is labelled with the variable(s) through which the pointed class or struct is accessible.A yellow dashed arrow denotes a relation between a template instance and the template class it was instantiated from. The arrow is labelled with the template parameters of the instance.Generated by1.9.8
